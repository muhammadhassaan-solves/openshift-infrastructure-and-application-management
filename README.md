<h1>Practical OpenShift for DevOps</h1>  

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is part of my personal portfolio where I practiced real-world OpenShift tasks used in DevOps and system administration.  
I completed 18 labs covering everything from app deployment to automation, storage, monitoring, and CI/CD inside an OpenShift cluster.


<h2>What I Practiced</h2>

- Setting up and managing OpenShift clusters  
- Deploying and scaling containerized apps  
- Creating persistent volumes and storage classes  
- Making apps reliable using high availability  
- Performing updates and rollbacks  
- Troubleshooting OpenShift issues  
- Checking logs and monitoring performance  
- Exposing services using routes and ingress  
- Doing rolling, blue-green, and canary deployments  
- Working with StatefulSets for stateful apps  
- Managing CPU/memory resources  
- Setting up RBAC and applying security policies  
- Automating tasks using Jobs and CronJobs  
- Exploring networking inside OpenShift  
- Running OpenShift on cloud setups  
- Testing cluster high availability  
- Tuning performance for better efficiency  
- Building CI/CD pipelines inside OpenShift
